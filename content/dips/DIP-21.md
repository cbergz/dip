## Simple Summary

In an effort to increase governance participation at the forum-stage of the governance process, a suggestion to move to Discourse from Commonwealth was made.

## Abstract

In an effort to increase governance participation at the forum-stage of the governance process, a suggestion to move to Discourse from Commonwealth was made.
Community participation (and increasing community participation) is essential in progressively decentralizing any DeFi protocol within our industry. 
Discourse would provide the dYdX Community with a seamless UI experience for discussing prospective governance proposals at the forum stage of the governance process (a vector that, alone, could lead to increased participation).
Discourse has been tried and tested by various well-established communities within the industry and has proven to be the ideal option for a governance forum platform.

The Snapshot was concluded concluded as follows: https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0xa5e77732dd24edd26bd41b089969b3662c29eb41c3bacd35cb2931ca55882a8f
(21M DYDX 99.96% - Yes | 7.5K DYDX 0.04% - No)

## Motivation

The motivation underlying the DIP is one - the progressive decentralisation of the dYdX Protocol. Without an active community underlying the protocol, efforts for effective and progressive decentralisation could well and truly fall mute. The purpose of the DIP was to provide the community with better and adequate tools (in this case a forum) to discuss, debate and propose changes to the dYdX Ecosystem. It is my belief that this change alone could bring an increase in participation at the forum-stage however, more has to be done to funnel further users and incenivise thought-sharing and diplomatic debate in an ever-increasing manner. This is just the first step underatken in an effort to increase dYdX Community participation and progressively decentralise. 
## Specification

The technical specifications relate to the transition to a new forum platform (Discourse). This will soon be launched by the dYdX Operations Sub-DAO. 

## Rationale

The Community has long been addressing its frustrations with the Commonwealth platform. These concerns were addressed numerous times but the necessary changes were not implemented. Thus, a transition to Discourse was suggested so as to optimise this stage of the governance process.
